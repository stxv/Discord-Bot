The main purpose of this project was to create a bot that could be implemented into personal discord servers while being able to develop practical skills for programming. With this project, I learned about API calling, JSON, and creating functions that carry out specific actions. Though it may be a very basic beginner project, I hope to create more projects that will solve problems and inconveniences.
